Right now we are holding our November & December Shopping Festival for the upcoming Christmas season.   
Free prototyping for Christmas PCB until December 10th.  
And there is a 2nd PCB design contest where the winner can win $1000.  

So this rather simple project to convert my outdoor PIR lamp to mains electricity is not something I'd normally video, but I thought there might be value in it, as we discussed diodes at least!  

Using one of the ubiquitous phone (USB) chargers I have lying around seemed a good use of existing resources, along with a cheap micro USB breakout board.  

With just a small amount of DIY and maker skills it was completed in a couple of (non-contiguous) days as I recovered from my eye-op.  

So now I have a nice, bright LED PIR light above my workshop door so I can see where the lock is, and it runs off mains via the aforementioned phone charger - no more expensive batteries. I wonder if I could describe this as an Eco-project?

USB breakout board (NB does NOT convert to serial, it just exposes the USB connections)
